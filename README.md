# FWCultivation_SJK_2022

Summer of 2022 Lab Project at Cornell University By: Sam Katz

The project will focus on cultivating particle associated freshwater microbes around chitin micro-particles from Beebe Lake. 



Project Reflections:
If I were to do this again I would increase the amount of beads per ml. We used ~100 bead/ml resulting in ~1000 beads per test tube. I think it could be doubled or maybe even tripled to make plating easier.
I also would have made the FAMV Media better, I forgot to check the PH before plating and due to the low growth i suspect the PH was off. 
Plating 1 ml of fluid on the Petri plates was good for getting growth but was too much liquid for the size of the plate in my opinion. I think this would be better with a ~400 or 250 Micro liter of the liquid being plated. 100 micro liter worked very well. 
Slim to none of my plates past 10^-3 dilutions had growth of any kind. These plated could likely be repurposed to get a better ratio and amount of inoculum to increase likely hood of getting large amounts of growth.
